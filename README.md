# Password Strength Calculator

## Project Overview
A demonstration of combinatorics principles applied to password security analysis.

## Mathematical Concepts Used
- **Product Rule**: Calculating total possibilities as N^L
- **Character Sets**: Analysis of different character combinations
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measuring password randomness

## How It Works
The calculator determines password strength by:
1. Identifying the character set used (lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols)
2. Applying the product rule: Total combinations = N^L
3. Estimating time to crack based on modern attack speeds

## Example Calculations
- 8-char lowercase only: 26^8 = 208 billion combinations
- 8-char with full keyboard: 94^8 = 6 quadrillion combinations
